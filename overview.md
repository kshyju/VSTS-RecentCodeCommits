Recent Code Commits Widget helps you to quickly see the recent commits to  your team project in a dashboard widget.

Commits will be displayed as a slide show as well.

You can configure the widget to get data for 

1. Current sprint
2. Last 7 days
3. Last 24 hours
4. Everything 

The configure screen also allows you get data from a specific project/source code path. This is really handy when you are interested in monitoring a specific sub direcory/project.

You can also adjust the size of the widget as needed.

By default,the extension will pick a suitable title for your widget based on the data it is displaying, but you can overwrite it by providing a custom title.
